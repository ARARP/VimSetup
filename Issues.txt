It turns out that the csexact plugin expects the rgb.txt file to be present in the
VIMRUNTIMEPATH to interpret colors. And for some reason this file is not present 
in the chrooted environment. So I just copied the rgb.txt into VimSetup/bundle/
so that I do not have to worry about downloading it again.
